# PyBer_Analysis
### PyBer with Matplotlib
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
### A ride share company called Pyber wants us to analyze data surrounding different city types to create a dataframe and line graph to show the differnces in rural, suburban, and urban cities. That includes the different fares, riders, and te amount that is used.
## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
### This is what happened after merging two data sets. With the use of groupby we can see the results with the differences of the different city types.

### Based off of the chart we can see...
### - The urban city type has a recorded 1,625 of total rides which is more rides then the combination of both rural and suburban. Once again the Urban city type has more total drivers as a whole 2,405 which is more then the rural and suburban combined. The amount of total drivers in the urban city exceeds the amount of total rides meaning not all drivers received a ride.  The total amount of fares is $39,854.38 with the average fare per ride $24.53 and per driver $16.57. This results in the urban city having the least cost for fare.
### - The Suburban had more total rides over there total drivers. This results in being the medium for average fare per ride and driver.
### - The Rural has the least amount of total rides and drivers. The rural city does have more total rides over drivers. The total amount of Fares therefore was the least with $4,327.93 with an average of each fare costing $34.62 per ride which results to being the highest in fares. The average fare per driver is the highest as well with $55.49. This results for the Rural to have the most cost for fare.

### This new dataframe for the line graph allows us to view the results through multiple months.
### Just like the first dataframe we can see that the Urban market gains the most amount of fares with suburban and rural following after. We can see that each city type does reach a peak at the end of Febuary. The Urban city continues to go up and down from March to April and in April is steady until the end of April. The Suburban city drops until the end of April. The Rural ends up having a higher peak in April then keeps steady.
## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
### 1. The data should show the amount of time a guest spends on each ride. It would make sence that the Urban city makes more money there are more people in a city verses a rural country side. 
### 2. Like mentioned Earlier with the amount of drivers in the Urban city technically speaking not every driver would have a ride so having a limit to the amount of drivers each area has might be an option because if there are to many employees that basically only half the amount of employees actually gets a ride the supply is to much over the demand for the drivers so I would cut back. If its like uber they have like a waiting time because this happens in Orlando if the demand needs it they will have a spot if they dont they tel you to wait.
### 3. Showing the amount of people in each type of area type and percentage.
